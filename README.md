# RetrAction

An interpreter and compiler for the Action programming language. Not yet complete.

## Status

Currently tokenizes all of the Action! language.

Parser parses expressions and a few other things, generating bytecode. No routines, if/while/etc., variable handling...

Symbol table and types seem to be on the right path, though incomplete.

VM interprets expressions (though without correct type checking/handling).
